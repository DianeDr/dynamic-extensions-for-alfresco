Dynamic Extensions for Alfresco
===============================

Rapid development of Alfresco repository extensions in Java. Deploy your code in seconds, not minutes. Life is too short for endless server restarts.

Officially supported Alfresco versions
--------------------------------------

Dynamic Extensions is developed and tested against

* Alfresco Community 3.4
* Alfresco Community 4.0

These versions are officially tested before a release. In practice Dynamic Extensions works just fine in Alfresco Enterprise 4.0, and it will probably work on the recently released Community 4.2 as well.

OSGi container
--------------

Dynamic Extensions adds an OSGi container to Alfresco, enabling live deployment of Java code packaged as OSGi's bundles. The use of OSGi is kept under the hood, however.
